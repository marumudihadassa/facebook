one class has reference of another class is called aggregation
agregation is also know as "has-a" relation which is weak relation

in below hero class has reference of adrees,movies
class Address
{
int dno;
string street;
Adress(int dno,String street)
{
this.dno=dno;
this.street=street;
}
}
 
class Movie
{
int tmov,bmov;
Movie(int tmov,int bmov)
{
this.tmov=tmov;
this.bmov=bmov;
}}

class Hero{
string name;
int age;
doublde height;
Adress arr;//creation of class variables;
Movie m;
Hero(string nmae,int age,double height,Address arr,Movie m)
{
this.name=name...........}
void disp()
{
sout(name)...
sout("addr"+arr.dno+arr.street);
sout("hero movies"+m.tmov+m.bmov);}
psvm(sa)
{
Adress a1=new adress(11,madh);
movi m1=new movie(78,98)
Hero h1=new Hero(chiru,54,5.7,a1,m1);}}

COMPOSTION: strong aggregation is called composition;
    ex:relation btwn colege and dept is strong relation once we destroy the coleg object the dept obj becomes useless.....
